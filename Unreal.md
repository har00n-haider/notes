### Collision

Blocking collisions only happen when both entities are mutually blocking each other. e.g. 

| moving     | B | B | I | I |
|------------|---|---|---|---|
| stationary | I | B | I | B |
| can pass?  | Y | N | Y | Y |

### Generated folders

These folders are generated by UE when compiling and running a game project. They are not commited to source control. Some compile/intellisense issues can be solved by deleting and regenerating these folders.


- Binaries
- Build
- DerivedDataCache
- Intermediate
- Saved

Sometimes the VS project itself and its ".vs" settings folder could also cause issues, so deleting them and regenerating the vs project file can help with issues (e.g. when new code files are added etc.)

### Build issues 

Error message:

> Could not be compiled. Try rebuilding from source manually.

- This message usually arises when there is C++ code associated with the project that cannot be compiled. 
- Can also happen because there are modules associated with the file that used to have code, but were removed from the project. You can solve this by manually removed the offending modules from the uproject files:
Could not be compiled. Try rebuilding from source manually:
```
{
	"FileVersion": 3,
	"EngineAssociation": "4.25",
	"Category": "",
	"Description": "",

        // This module was causing the issue (probably because I added C++ code
        // there at some point but deleted it after.
	"Modules": [
		{
			"Name": "ThirdPersonProject",
			"Type": "Runtime",
			"LoadingPhase": "Default"
		}
	]
}
```


# Loading assets


There seem to be a number of ways to load assets from the contents folder in C++:

1. Using the UAssetManager with the GetAssetDataForPath function
2. Using the UKismetSystemLibrary::LoadAsset_Blocking (or asynchronous)
3. Using ConstructorHelpers::FObjectFinder<T> after checking the Succeeded() flag
4. Using LoadObject<T>()


# Garbage collection

## Key points

- Only those classes that inherit from UObject will be considered for GC. All other classes need to do deal with their own memory management (e.g using smart pointers)
- UObjects can be added to a rootset in orded to protect them from the GC.
